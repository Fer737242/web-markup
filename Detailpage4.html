            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                With around 76,804 residents nowadays, the history of Zaandam and the surrounding Zaan River region (the Zaanstreek) is intimately tied to industry. In the Dutch Golden Age, Zaandam served as a large milling centre. Thousands of windmills powered saws that processed Scandinavian wood for the shipbuilding and paper industries. A statue that commemorates this industry was commissioned from sculptor Slavomir Miletić, ”De houtwerker” ("The Woodworker"), was installed on 20 June 2004.
                This is an amazing village, and the very peculiar and famous hotel is here, the “Inntel Hotels Zaandam”, with its creative design overlapping green wooden facades typical of traditional houses in the region. Designed by Molenaar & Van Winden architecten, possibly has more visitors due to the façade than to the morning breakfast.
